Echo Web Server
===============

**echo-web-server** is a minimalistic [Node.js&reg;][1] web server that logs client requests to the terminal and echos them back to the client as a basic HTML page.
Deployment can be as simple as copying a single script file, `lib/echo-web-server.js`, to the desired location and executing it with whatever version of *Node.js* happens to be installed.

The [ES2015][2] source code in `src` is fully compatible with [*Node.js* v6][3] without transformation or runtime flags.
Developer dependencies, [`babel-cli`][4], [`babel-preset-es2015`][5], and [`nodemon`][6], are necessary only if you want to modify the *ES6* source code and then run Echo on a *v4*, or earlier, *Node.js* runtime.


Single-File Use
---------------
You can simply copy `echo-web-server.js` from `lib` to any location you want and execute an Echo server by typing `node echo-web-server.js`.
Echo will start logging any requests it recieves to the terminal.

For example, if a client requests `http://localhost:8080/my/request/is super`, Echo will log the following to the console:

    Client [127.0.0.1] Requested: /my/request/is super!

And send a HTML page like the following to the client:

    You sent the request:
        http://localhost:8080/my/request/is super!
    Echo recieved the request as:
        http://0.0.0.0:8080/my/request/is super!

Scripts
-------
* `start`: Starts the web server and begins echoing client requests.
* `build`: Transforms the *ES6* source code in `src` into *ES5*-compatible source code in `lib`.
  You **must** install the dev dependencies before building.
* `watch`: Uses `nodemon` to watch the `lib` folder and restarts Echo if anything changes.
* `node6`: Uses `nodemon` to watch the `src` folder and restarts Echo if anything changes.
  There's no need to transform the *ES6* source code when running on *Node v6* or newer.


Customization
-------------
To customize the `server` and `port` Echo listens on, set the `ECHO_WEB_SERVER_HOST` and `ECHO_WEB_SERVER_PORT` environment variables.
Defaults are `0.0.0.0` and `8080` respectively.
